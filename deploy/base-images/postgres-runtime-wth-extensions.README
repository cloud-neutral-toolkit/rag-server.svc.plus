# TL;DR – PostgreSQL Multi-Model Runtime

A lightweight PostgreSQL build providing **Search + Vector + KV + MQ + JSONB**
as a unified data engine for CloudNeutral-Suite applications.

## Includes
- **pg_jieba** – Chinese full-text tokenizer
- **pg_trgm** – fuzzy search and typo tolerance
- **pgvector** – embeddings and semantic search
- **pgmq** – lightweight message queue (Kafka-lite)
- **JSONB + GIN** – document store and structured filtering
- **hstore + UNLOGGED tables** – high-speed key/value cache

## Use Cases
- Documentation, product, and FAQ search
- RAG and embedding-based retrieval
- Application-level KV/session/cache
- Lightweight event queues and workflows
- JSONB content and metadata storage
- Hybrid keyword + semantic search

## Not Included
Platform-level or DBA-oriented extensions are intentionally excluded:
- timescaledb
- pg_partman
- pg_cron
- pg_net

## Why
Keeps the runtime focused, predictable, and portable —
a single ACID engine replacing MongoDB + Redis + Kafka + Elasticsearch + Pinecone
for application-scale workloads.
