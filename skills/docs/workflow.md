# Workflow

Follow this process for any documentation maintenance request.

1. **Read constraints**
   - Open `docs/schema.md` and confirm the allowed structure.
   - Identify which doc files the user explicitly requested to change.

2. **Collect evidence**
   - Locate relevant code/config files in the repository.
   - Do not use external sources.

3. **Plan minimal edits**
   - Change only user-specified doc files.
   - Avoid unrelated formatting or wording changes.

4. **Apply changes**
   - Update content with strictly factual statements supported by the repo.
   - Keep the changes minimal and local to the request.

5. **Verify**
   - Ensure every new statement can be traced to repository evidence.
   - Ensure no schema violations were introduced.

6. **Report**
   - Summarize changes and list evidence files used.
   - If blocked, state what is missing and stop.
